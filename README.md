## Car parts webshop

This project is an example of a shopping cart webpage.

It contains a classic header with non-functional menu and search components. 
In the main content, there are tables with two products and product information that is important to the customer.
Also in the main content there is a sidebar element that provides information about the estimated shipping price and information about the final cost (order total).
The links are not functional (do not lead anywhere).

The Estimate Shipping and Tax section is interactive (on click expands for additional info).
