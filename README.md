## Car parts webshop

This project is my example of shopping cart webpage. 

It contains classic header with non-functional menu and search components. 
In the main content there are tables with two products and product information that is important to the customer.
Also in the main content, there is a sidebar element that provides information of the estimated shipping price and information of final cost (order total).
Links are not functional (do not lead anywhere).

The Estimate Shipping and Tax section is interactive (on click expands for additional info).
